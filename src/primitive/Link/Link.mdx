## Introduction

The `Link` component is a wrapper around MUI Joy's `Link` component by default.  

The prominent feature of this component is that you can pass in a custom component using the `Component` prop, offering a way to utilise Next Js Routing to any Joy Component of your choosing.
The user is provided with the flexibility to utilise the component as a drop in replacement for the MUI Joy Link component.

This component supports the basic <b>href</b> and <b>target</b> props,
Additional features include:
- The flexibility to style the component using the `sx` prop. The MUI joy sytling props are applied to the component using the `sx` prop
- onclick handler is supported to pass in a function that is called when this Custom Link is clicked.

## Basic Usage
<Alert color="info" variant="soft">
  When using the Link component for internal routing, it automatically uses Next.js Link component, ensuring optimal performance and routing behavior.

## Examples








### Custom Styling
<Alert color="warning" variant="soft">
  The default Link component (without a custom Component prop) applies some base styles for <strong>background</strong> and <strong>hover</strong> states. 
  These can be overridden by providing your own styles in the `sx` prop. If you need full control over all styles, consider passing in a custom Component.
</Alert>


You can pass in a custom styling object to the `sx` prop to style the component. The following example is a custom styled link with a hover effect.




<Canvas of={LinkStories.CustomStyling} />

### Custom Component

<Canvas of={LinkStories.CustomComponent} />
